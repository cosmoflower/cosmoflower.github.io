title: Why write something useless when there is a lot of useful things to do
---

Heyho. There has been a lot happening. Last week I started visiting a shrink. An interesting conversation, but nothing special for now. Unfortunately, the next appointment is in a month. Long time.

Also, I've had a failed tinder date& This was fun actually, I was wandering around a park where we should have met alone. Frozen.

Btw, started smoking again. Bad.

On monday I had the one of the most active days in a long while. I did several job tasks and had a shooting session about my work with my collegues. This was fun.

The title is totally unrelated, but I don't give a damn.
