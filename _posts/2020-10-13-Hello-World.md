title: Another useless blog!
---

Hi. This is probably one of those cases, when a person sets the blog up, then posts shit for two-three days, and abandons it forever. It is a badly written, unpolite, unstructured flow of thoughts, which noone should ever be reading. So, if you're here somehow, run, I guess. Or don't. I don't care.

if a bit more serious, let's say that this is the chronicle of fighting the darkness inside (how pretentious!). I am not calling this a depression, mostly because I wasn't diagnosed with it. For now, cauciously let's refer to my condition as a burnout. I have hard times concentrating on my work, on my hobbies (like if they exist), I neglect my hygiene, my diet, the cleanliness of my apartment. Probably this is not a burnout after all.

I constantly whine about how powerless I am to my friends (thank cosmos there are some), but I get tired of myself. So, I decided to whine into endless nothingness. And feel a little more like a millenial hipster with the most important problems in the world that I want to tell about to everyone around me. So, I hope this helps, otherwise those millenial hipsters are just making useless noise in the infospace simply to feel greater than they are.

All of us are just specs of dust put together by chance. And this is beautiful.
