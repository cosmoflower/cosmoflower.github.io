title: Night thoughts
---

Sometimes I feel insane. The amount of sillyness per second in my brain is overloading all meters. You feel contained and closed with your thoughts in your head. And there is nowhere to escape. These times are tough, usually they happen close to bedtime. Doesn't make it much easier to fall asleep. 

My usual problem is the self-esteem, and the issues with my work. The powerlessness during the day results in restlessness in the night. I whink about all the things I should have done, work tasks, home business, throwing the trash, ironing the clothes, having a shower eventually. I get angry when people ask me how's my work, did I do anything. One moment I feel totally in balance and the next second I want to go smash something. Then, after a few minutes, I get ashamed and want to excuse. Can say something just being noxious, things I don't truly think.

What helps to at least ease the tension is music. And nice tv shows. Not the junk to forget yourself and your problems (that is youtube). But a proper media. I fancy British tv shows, they really help to keep the chin a bit up. The music -- the I am the Doctor tune always inspires me to at least look at the issues differently. Not once this was extremely helpful. Now I am listneting to RHCP's Snow song, love it. Actually, I love since the trailer for the Death Note movie (Japanese one, not the Netflix crap), a very unfitting soundtrack to it, but such a pleasant song. I love snow, can't wait for it. Now there's only rain.

My meditation also of great help. Recently I started zazen'ing regularly, a tremendous effect. It actually helps to bound the anxiety, even when not meditating. Some breathing practices can even relax me in the stress. Never thought it is so effective. I heard multiple times it helps, but I was thinking you have to practice it for months to get some result, but it improved the situation straght away.
