title: Wow, I didn't drop this after the first post!

But it actually doesn't mean anything, because I am posting this a few minutes after the first one. I am new into this atrocious world that people call Eeentrnet. No idea how people older that 20 use it, there are only kids out there!

Anyhow, I am testing how this thing works. Pretty convenient actually. Even my mom could handle this. Now, I feel great that I am capable of writing words that connect into sensible sentances, but really hope that it would not crowd out my main work. Because throwing your guts into this is easy, and it feels like I have done something useful today, buuut no.
